I'm a student at MÃ¤lardalen University with a passion for coding and design. I have experience with several major programming languages and frameworks, web development, app development, graphical design and photography. I speak English, Swedish, Czech, German and Russian fluently and I love learn new languages, both natural and artificial.

As a computer science student at the bachelor's level I've been a part of several exciting projects, most of which are available open-source on my Github page together with some of my personal mini-projects in which I've explored some interesting concepts in computer science in more detail.

For my thesis work I have chosen to investigate evolutionary algorithms and swarm algorithms.
